### Hi there 👋
I'm Developer located in Krakow - Poland. Currently working as a front end developer, I'm coding designs and templates to our corporate CMS.
I'm mainly focused on Front End - especially React, but I also know the basics of backend ( express / php ).

Currently learning in high school with IT specialization. I will be honored if You will give me tips / scroll through my projects! (I'm begginer, code review is always wanted 😅)

Cheers! 🍒🍒🍒
